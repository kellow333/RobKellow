        <p>Prior to 2010 I worked in the Trade and DIY sector of the retail industry. After working 
            in the retail sector for many years, due to personal circumstances I took a year out to 
            look after my family. This gave me time to reflect on my career. Even though looking after
            my two children was very fulfilling, I wanted to utilise the little free time I had. This
            is where I instigated plans to get a qualification as a platform that would allow me into
            higher education to study Computer Science. This would allow me to fulfil my ambition to obtain
            employment in the IT sector, with the prospect of obtaining a career in programming or web 
            development.</p>

        <p>I am now 4 years on and have recently qualified from Cardiff University with a First 
            Class Honours and ready to take the next step in my career goals. I am ambitious, 
            eager to learn and currently looking for a suitable entry level web developer position 
            with an exciting progressive employer.</p>

        <p>Although my children take up a lot of my spare time I enjoy experimenting with web-based technologies.
            My current projects include a Formula 1 stats site using AngularJS framework and starting to teach my self and 
            expeimenting with C# and ASP.NET. I also like to play golf, badly I might add, and I run to keep fit. I am also a fanatical 
            Formula 1 fan and enjoy keeping up with the latest technologies involved within the sport 
            as I am the racing.</p>

        <p>I like to create user-friendly websites and applications using my experience in front-end technologies 
             HTML, CSS, JavaScript.I also pocesses good knowledge and experience of back-end processes and technologies
              such as PHP and MySQL allowing easy integration of back-end functionalty into front-end applications.</p>

        <p>I like my products to be responsive allowing the end user to experience the wesite in the best 
            possibly way, most suited to the device they are using. All code is easy to read and well documented 
            meaning it can be easily maintained, allowing others to quickly and easily work with it, and 
            scaled in the future.</p>

        <p>I pride myself on fully testing any website or application in a wide range of areas, from cross 
            browser compatabilty to performace to usabilty testing, to ensure the end product 
            is of the highest quality.</p>

        <p>I understand and have experience in all aspects of the design process. I can effectively
        communicate and build a rapport with clients to understand and establish their needs, 
        allowing me to efficiently build a set of requirements and specifications. Requirements can then
        be used to produce fully comprehensive designs using a variety of tools such as 
        Balsamiq for wireframes and Adobe Photoshop or Fireworks for more detailed mockups.</p>
