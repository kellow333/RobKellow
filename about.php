            <h2 id="intro-statement">A competent and committed recent Computer Science graduate from Cardiff university, with 
             keen interest in web development.</h2>        
            
        </div>
        <p>Since leaving school I have had many jobs from, house removals, bar work to holding management 
            positions in the retail industry. All these positions have given me diverse qualities to enable me to adjust to different situations. My most recent job will tell you more about myself than any other position I have held.</p>

        <p>I started as a customer assistant and within a year was promoted to a supervisory position; 
            this was due to hard work, focus and dedication. This position I held for three years and then, 
            again due to all of the above I was fast tracked into Assistant Manager. This promotion was a 
            great learning curve as the role involved new skills and a different way of relating to colleagues 
            and customers; also I held a great deal of responsibility and it required good organisational skills.
             This role taught me a great deal about myself, I had to adapt, learn and realise my responsibility. 
             I gained experience by being in the role, so I had to learn quickly to become as efficient as 
             possible. In relation, these qualities will be transferable to a graduate web developer position 
             as it shows my ability to learn and adapt, therefore I feel that I will learn quickly and competently.</p>

        <p>After working in the retail industry for many years, due to personal circumstances I took a year out
            to look after my family. This gave me time to reflect on what I was going to do next and even though 
            looking after my two children was very fulfilling I still needed to make plans for my future career 
            options. This is where I instigated plans to get a qualification as a platform that would allow me 
            into higher education to study Computer Science. This would allow me to fulfill my ambition to obtain 
            employment in the IT sector, with the prospect of obtaining a career in programming or web development.</p>

        <p>I am now 4 years on and have recently qualified from Cardiff university with a First Class Honours and 
            ready to take the next step in my career goals. I am ambitious, eager to learn and currently looking 
            for a suitable entry level web developer position with an exciting progressive employer.</p>

        <p>Although my children take up a lot of my spare time I enjoy experimenting with coding. I also like to 
            play golf, badly I might add, and I run to keep fit. I am also a fanatical Formula 1 fan and enjoy 
            keeping up with the latest technologies involved within the sport as I am the racing.</p>

             </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>I like to create user-friendly websites and applications using my experience in front-end web 
            based languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and especially like playing around with CSS3 animations. 
            I also pocesses good knowledge and experience of back-end processes and languages such as PHP and MySQL 
            allowing easy integration of back-end functionalty into front-end applications.</p>

        <p>I like my products to be responsive allowing the end user to experience the wesite is the best 
            possibly way, most suited to the device they are using. All code is easy to read and well documented 
            meaning it can be easily maintained, allowing team members to quickly and easily work with it, and 
            scaled in the future.</p>

        <p>I pride myself on fully testing any website or appliactions in a wide range of areas, from cross 
            browser compatabilty to performace to usabilty testing, before final release to ensure the end product 
            is of the highest quality.</p>

             </ul>
        </div>

        <p>I understand and have experience in all aspects of the design process that creates an end product 
            that both meets the clients needs and is effective, user-friendly and appealing to the end user.</p>

        <p>I can effectively communicate with clients to understand and establish their needs, allowing me to 
            efficiently build a set of requirements and specifications. Requirements can then be used to produce fully comprehensive designs using a variety of tools such as Balsamiq for wireframes and Adobe Photoshop and Fireworks for more detailed mockups.</p>
