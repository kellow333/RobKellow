        <h2>Remyroo - ecommerce website</h2>
        <br>
        <hr class="title-line">
        <p>Remyroo is an ecommerce site run by a family memeber that sells organic kids clothes. The site was initially set up by the family memeber using Big Cartel hosting and using one of their templates. After implementing the site there were many features that the family member wanted to add but just couldn't due to the overly restrictive nature of the template. You couldn't even add images to pages that aren't part of the shop.</p>
        <p>I helped by changing and adding to the source HTML and CSS. I was able to implement the features that were wanted.These include:</p>    

        <div id="about-list">
            <ul>
                <li>Custom content and styling</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>About page</li>
                        <li>Brands page</li>
                        <li>Newsletter page</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Fonts not supplied with the template</li>
                <li>Newsletter implementation via MailChimp</li>
                <li>Custom social media icons on Home page</li>
                <li>Many other small changes to the layout above and beyond what the template will allow
             </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Although not a whole project in itself, it shows that I can work with an existing site and make client changes as necessary.
